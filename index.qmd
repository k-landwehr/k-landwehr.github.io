## **About Me**

Hello! I am a highly motivated student at Colorado State University pursuing my interest in the environment through my studies in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I am passionate about conserving Earth's natural resources and am currently exploring opportunities in renewable energy and sustainability consulting.

Outside of academics I enjoy hiking, skiing, reading, and baking!
