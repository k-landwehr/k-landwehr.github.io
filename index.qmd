  Hello! I am a highly motivated student at Colorado State University pursuing my interest in the environment through my studies in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I am passionate about conserving Earth's natural resources and am currently pursuing interests in renewable energy and sustainability consulting.
  
  Outside of academics I enjoy hiking, skiing, reading, and baking!
