**Overview**

Below are some projects I have developed during my time as a student a Colorado State University. 

**Water Focused**

As an honors student I compiled research on the impacts of agriculture on water quality and developed a flyer to share with the students of Sustainable Watersheds, Spring 2024.

In the same semester, I developed an eye-catching timeline to model water scarcity through the Tigris-Euphrates River Basin.
