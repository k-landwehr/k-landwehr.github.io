## **Overview**

Below are some projects I have developed during my time as a student a Colorado State University.

### **Water Focused**

As an honors student I compiled research on the impacts of agriculture on water quality and developed a flyer to share with the students of Sustainable Watersheds, Spring 2024.

I also developed a timeline to highlight water scarcity issues in the Tigris-Euphrates River Basin.

### **GIS**

I also have GIS experience and have created an ArcGIS StoryMap to display the most suitable areas for wolverine introduction in Colorado's Roaring Fork Watershed.

Here is my embedded StoryMap:
